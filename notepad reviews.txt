I have only been on Tekturna for 9 days. The effect was immediate. I am also on a calcium channel blocker (Tiazac) and hydrochlorothiazide. I was put on Tekturna because of palpitations experienced with Diovan (ugly drug in my opinion, same company produces both however). The palpitations were pretty bad on Diovan, 24 hour monitor by EKG etc. After a few days of substituting Tekturna for Diovan, there are no more palpitations.

I just got diagnosed with type 2. My doctor prescribed Invokana and metformin from the beginning. My sugars went down to normal by the second week. I am losing so much weight. No side effects yet. Miracle medicine for me
